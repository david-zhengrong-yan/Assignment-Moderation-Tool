COMP30022 IT Project — Deakin University Psychology Department  
Developed for **Carrie Ewin**, Psychology Lecturer at Deakin University. A web-based system for automating assignment moderation workflows at Deakin University.

---

## Overview

The **Assignment Moderation Tool** is a full-stack web platform designed to automate the marking moderation workflow used in Deakin University’s School of Psychology.

Each semester, Carrie coordinates approximately **10 tutors** who all mark the same student assignments.  
Currently, moderation involves Excel spreadsheets, email comparisons, and manual difference calculations — an error-prone and time-consuming process.

This project replaces those manual steps with an integrated digital system that:

- Hosts assignments and rubrics in one place,  
- Allows **all tutors** to mark the **same assignments**,  
- Automatically aggregates and analyzes tutor marks,  
- Highlights inconsistencies, and  
- Generates performance analytics for the professor.

### General Notes

- **Environment Variables:** Use `.env` files for sensitive info (database URL, secret key, etc.).

- **Static & Media Files:** Uploaded rubrics, PDFs, and images are stored in `backend/media/`.

- **Frontend/Backend Communication:** All API requests use session authentication. Ensure backend server is running before testing frontend.

## Testing

Testing ensures that all system components — frontend, backend, and integrations — operate correctly before deployment. This section outlines the manual and automated testing processes, along with known issues and resolutions encountered during development.

### Manual Test

Manual testing was conducted to validate functionality, performance, and code quality across both frontend and backend components.
The process also included running linting tools (ESLint & Pylint) and Django unit tests to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

#### Frontend Manual Testing (React + Vite)

Developers and testers can manually verify the frontend functionality and run lint checks using ESLint.

**Steps to Run Manual Tests**

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `frontend/` directory:
  ```
  cd frontend
  ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

  - Open the app at [http://localhost:5173]() (default Vite port).

  - Verify UI components, navigation, and data rendering.

3. Run ESLint to check code quality:
  ```
  npm run lint
  ```

  - This scans all `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx` files.

  - Any style or syntax errors will be displayed in the terminal.

4. Fix reported issues manually or with automatic formatting (optional): 
  ```
  npm run lint -- --fix
  ```

### Automated Test

The project integrates continuous integration (CI) through GitHub Actions to automatically test, lint, and validate both the frontend and backend on every code change.

This ensures that all commits and pull requests maintain consistent code quality and do not break existing functionality.

#### Workflow Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow file is stored at:

```
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```
It is triggered automatically on:

- Every push to any branch

- Every pull request to any branch

This guarantees that all changes are validated before being merged into the main branch.

#### CI Jobs and Responsibilities

The workflow defines **four main jobs:**

1. **python-lint** — Lint and format check for the Django backend

2. **react-lint** — Lint check for the React frontend

3. **backend-test** — Run Django unit tests

4. **summary** — Combine results and report outcomes

| Job Name       | Description                                               | Key Tools                 | Outcome                                     |

| python-lint    | Lints and format-checks backend Python files using pylint and black. | Pylint, Black             | Reports Python code quality and formatting issues. |
| react-lint     | Lints frontend JavaScript/JSX code for React components.  | ESLint                    | Reports syntax and best-practice issues in React. |
| backend-test   | Executes Django’s built-in test suite to validate backend functionality. | Django Test Framework     | Runs all tests in api/tests.py.            |
| summary        | Aggregates all test reports and outputs results in the Actions log. | —                         | Summarizes outcomes and fails PRs if any job fails. |


#### Workflow Description

##### Python Lint (Backend Quality Check)

- Sets up Python environment (3.x).

- Installs dependencies from `backend/requirements.txt`.

- Runs:
  ```
  pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
  black --check .
  ```

- Outputs results to `pylint-report.txt` and `black-report.txt`.

- Marks job as failed if linting errors are detected.

##### React Lint (Frontend Quality Check)

- Uses Node.js version 18.

- Installs frontend dependencies via:
  ```
  npm install
  ```

- Runs:
  ```
  npm run lint
  ```

- Saves lint results to eslint-report.txt.

- Marks job as failed if linting errors are found.

##### Backend Tests (Django Functional Testing)

- Sets up Python and installs backend dependencies.

- Runs Django’s unit tests with:
  ```
  python manage.py test --verbosity=2
  ```

- Logs all test case results in the GitHub Actions console.

- If any test fails, the job is marked as failed.

##### Summary Resport

- Collects reports from all previous jobs:

  - Python Lint Report (pylint-report.txt)

  - Black Format Report (black-report.txt)

  - React ESLint Report (eslint-report.txt)

  - Django Test Report (console output)

- If any job failed (`failed == true`), the workflow:
  ```
  exit 1
  ```
  This blocks pull requests from merging until all checks pass.

## Known bugs or TODOs in the code

One known issue that remains outstanding in the current implementation is the email feedback feature for markers, which has not yet been fully completed. The intended functionality is to allow moderators to send automated email notifications to tutors (markers) after moderation, summarizing feedback, requested changes, or approval of marks. While the backend structure for user roles and feedback storage is already in place within Django, the actual email sending logic—including configuration of the email service (e.g., SMTP setup or Django’s send_mail integration)—has not been finalized or tested. This feature should be implemented in future development to improve communication efficiency between moderators and tutors, ensuring feedback is delivered promptly and recorded for audit purposes.

In the current codebase, future developers who continue this feature should focus on two key areas:

- **Frontend – `MarkerPage.jsx`:** This React component is responsible for displaying the marker’s interface and should be updated to handle the email feedback prompt once an email has been successfully sent. Developers should add appropriate UI elements, such as a success message or notification banner, triggered after the backend confirms the email has been dispatched. Integration with the backend API endpoint that handles email sending will be required here.

- **Backend – `submission_mark_view(request, user_id, assignment_id, submission_id)` in `views.py`:** This Django view manages the finalization of a marker’s submission. When a marker completes marking and submits their results, this function is intended to trigger Django’s email service (e.g., via send_mail or a background task). Developers should implement or complete this logic to automatically send an email notification to the tutor or moderator. The function should also include proper error handling and logging for email delivery failures.

- **Email Configuration – `settings.py`:** The project already includes an email backend configuration with 
  ```
  EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend"
  ```
  This setup allows email messages to be printed to the console during local development and testing. Future developers should update this configuration to use a production-ready backend (e.g., SMTP or a transactional email service like SendGrid) when deploying to production.

Together, these components form the **email feedback workflow,** and any future development should ensure smooth communication between frontend and backend, as well as proper testing of the email delivery process in both development and production environments.

## Deployment

The Assignment Moderation Tool is fully deployed using Render, a cloud-based hosting platform that provides integrated services for static frontend hosting, Python web services, and managed PostgreSQL databases.

This setup supports continuous deployment from GitHub, ensuring automated builds, version control, and reliable hosting with minimal manual configuration.

| Database  | Managed Database  | PostgreSQL          | Stores user accounts, assignments, rubrics, marks, and moderation results.  |

Each service is deployed independently but linked through environment variables to allow secure communication and simplified scaling.

### Servier Environment Overview

#### Frontend

- **Runtime:** Node.js 18+

- **Build Command:**
  ```
  npm install && npm run build
  ```
- **Publish Directory:**
  ```
  dist
  ```
- **Start Command:** Render automatically serves static files once the build is complete

#### Backend

- **Runtime:** Python 3.10+

- **Build Command:**
  ```
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  set -o errexit

  pip install -r requirements.txt

  python manage.py collectstatic --no-input

  python manage.py migrate
  ```

- **Start Command:**
  ```
  gunicorn backend.wsgi:application
  ```

- **Working Directory:** `backend/`

#### Database (PostgreSQL)

- Managed instance automatically configured through Render’s “Add Database” option.

- Connection handled using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in Django settings.

### Environment Variables and Configuration

All environment variables are securely stored in the Render Dashboard under the respective service settings. They replace sensitive data stored in configuration files like `settings.py` or `.env`.

| Variable               | Description                                   | Example                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| SECRET_KEY             | Django secret key for encryption and sessions. | django-insecure-xyz123abc                       |
| DEBUG                  | Set to False in production.                   | False                                           |
| DATABASE_URL           | PostgreSQL connection string.                 | postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname    |
| ALLOWED_HOSTS          | Allowed frontend and API domains.             | ["frontend.onrender.com", "backend.onrender.com"] |
| CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS   | Whitelisted frontend URLs for API access.    | https://frontend.onrender.com                  |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER        | For sending notifications (if applicable).   | example@deakin.edu.au                           |


#### Frontend Configuration

- Backend API endpoint is defined in: 
  ```
  src/constants.js
  ```
  the code:
  ```
  const DEPLOY_API="https://68d69d40-72ab-4896-bc17-b3c190219391-dev.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapis.dev/assignment-moderation/backend/v1.0"

  export function getApiBaseUrl() {
      return import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL ?  import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL : DEPLOY_API;
  }
  ```
  switch between the local backend api and deployment backend api, the constant `VITE_API_URL` is in the file `frontend/.env` which you need to create by yourself.
  ```
  VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"
  ```

### Deployment Steps

#### Frontend (React + Vite)

1. Push latest changes to the GitHub main branch.

2. Render automatically detects the commit and triggers a new build:

  - Installs dependencies (npm install)

  - Builds optimized production files (npm run build)

3. After successful build, the static files in /dist are deployed automatically.

**Manual Deployment (if auto-deploy is disabled):**

- Go to Render Dashboard → Frontend Service → **“Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit.”**

#### Backend (Django)

1. Push latest backend changes to the linked GitHub repository.

2. Render triggers the backend build:

  - Installs dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)

  - Runs migrations (python manage.py migrate)

  - Collects static files (if configured) 
    ```
    python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
    ```

3. Starts the Django server using `gunicorn backend.wsgi`.


**Manual Deployment:**

- Render Dashboard → Backend Service → **“Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit.”**

#### Database (PostgreSQL)

- Automatically provisioned through Render.

- Django connects via DATABASE_URL variable—no local config required.

- Backups can be configured via Render’s dashboard under the Database service.

- Variables are given in the handover document.

### Rollback Procedure

Render provides automatic rollback features in case a deployment fails or causes instability.

**To rollback the deployment:**

1. Open the Render Dashboard.

2. Select the affected service (Frontend or Backend).

3. Navigate to the Deploys tab.

4. Find the previous successful deployment.

5. Click “Rollback” to revert to that stable version.

**Alternatively:**

- You can manually revert the code in GitHub to a previous commit and push again.

- Render will automatically redeploy the reverted version.

### Render Free Plan Limitations and Post-Deployment Recommendations

Please refer to handover document for more information.
